Eyebot Plan:

Eyebots have vision cones offset to them depending on their direction.

	Facing Up:
		Middle, Top
	Facing Down:
		Middle, Bottom
	Facing Left:
		Left, Middle
	Facing Right:
		Right, Middle
		
The bots glide around in square and line patterns. Their behaviour is determined by the tiles in the environment, a-la N:
That is, if they fly into a tile, they turn clockwise 90 degrees.


If the character is spotted by the cone, they are shot with a laser and instantly killed.

The vision cone just needs to check certain square tiles it's on. Mainly, a line down the middle and towards the large end, one tile either side of that line.

This is fairly easy to do code-wise.

Even easier than checking all the spaces each time would be to only check the cone the if the tile the player is on is within the cone's square bounds. 
That way you're not checking so much! Plus, the inclusion of the tile that the player is on makes detection a little easier.

The cone simply finds if the player is in the view, and if they are, checks against their stealthstate.
